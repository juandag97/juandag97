### About me

ðŸ”­ Hey! Iâ€™m an electronic engineer based in PopayÃ¡n, Colombia. I enjoy working on full stack web development using MERN and MEAN stacks, and Iâ€™m comfortable with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. I also do mobile development with Flutter (Dart) and Android (Kotlin). Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into AI and GenAIâ€”playing with LLMs both on-prem and through platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and Hugging Face. I usually run these models on AWS and Azure, where Iâ€™ve built up about 5 years of experience. Oh, and Iâ€™m also into data engineering and web scraping with Seleniumâ€”got a few scrapers running around out there. So yeah, thatâ€™s a bit about what Iâ€™m into these days!

### What do I do for fun?

âš¡ Iâ€™m into musicâ€”love playing the guitar, piano, and drums, and I mess around a bit with composing too. Iâ€™m also a huge car enthusiast, especially when it comes to JDM legends like the Nissan R34 Skyline, GTR NISMO, Toyota Supra, and Subaru WRX. Right now I drive a humble Chevrolet Sail, but Iâ€™m dreaming of picking up a JDM project carâ€”maybe a Mitsubishi Evo boxtype, a Subaru Impreza, or a 90s Toyota to bring back to life. Iâ€™m also planning to launch a blog on my site soon where Iâ€™ll share thoughts on car tuning, electric vehicles, tech news, software dev, AI, and whatever else Iâ€™m into at the moment.

âš¡ Here it is my website: https://juandag97.github.io (http://juandavidacosta.com)

PS: Just honest work ðŸ˜„
