### About me

I'm an electronic engineer who lives in PopayÃ¡n, Colombia. I like to work in web development with MERN and MEAN also with relational databases as: PostgreSQL and MySQL,  mobile development with Flutter-Dart, and Android with Kotlin, also I love Machine Learning Engineering, I work with TF, PyTorch and pretrained models as: resnet, alexnet and darknet, finally I really enjoy Data Engineering and web scraping with Selenium, I have some scrappers running out there. So that's a litte about me and what I am actually working on.

### What I do for fun?

I like to play the guitar, the piano and the drums, with a little bit of composition. Plus I'm a car lover, especially of JDM cars like: the Nissan R34-Skyline, the Nissan GTR-NISMO, the Toyota Supra, and the Subaru WRX. Now I have a Chevrolet Sail (honest work). I hope to build a blog soon inside my webpage, about car tunning, electric cars, technology news, software development, artificial intelligence, and a little bit of everything.

Here it is my website: https://juandag97.github.io/meMyselfAndI/

PS: Just honest work :)

My inbox is always open. Whether you have a question, or you just want to say hi, I'll try to reply you back. Cheers.
